                Welcome to Nrby! We do everything we can to make it easier for you to host your events. Whether you want to host an event that is free or one that is ticketed, our platform can meet your needs. 
                We bring our events to our mobile app that makes your event accessible to anyone that uses it. We provide on the fly analytics of how your event compares to other events happening around you so you can host 
                your event on the day that makes the most sense to you.

                <div style=\"padding-top: 15px\">
                    <strong>This plugin is not meant as a replacement to our web app, but instead it is meant to supplement your ability to import your hosted event from our platform over to your WordPress website.</strong>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div style=\"padding-bottom: 15px\">
                To get started please go to https://portal.nrby.io/sign-up to signup up for an account to create events in our platform.

            <div style=\"padding-bottom: 15px\">
                After you signup for an account in our website and verify it in your email. Upon your first login, you will be prompted to complete the setup of your account through an onboarding pop-up. If you 
                should chose to opt in for paid ticketing, then be sure to follow through the organization setup to the end. If you do not, then you won't be able to host events with paid ticketing.

                Our widget can be clicked and dragged to the location on the screen you want your event(s) to be displayed, or you can add it the same way you would add any other widget to your page depending on the version of Wordpress you are using.
                
                
                <div style=\"padding-top: 15px\">

                After you click the \"Events Widget\" button the Widget popup will appear.

                \"Hide Events Table\" button.

                After you click the Import Events button, you will see the widget previewed in your website. Click the \"Update\" or \"Save\" button (circled red) in Wordpress to make the widget permanent. 
                <strong>Note: The table and Show/Hide Event Table button will not display in your final website. That is only for the editor screen.</strong>
